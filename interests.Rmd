## Sports
I enjoy a wide range of sports, particularly football, basketball, and table tennis. My favorite sport is swimming, which I practice weekly.

## Arts
I enjoy drawing. I received the First Class Prize at the National Drawing Contest for Middle School Students of China in 2011 (a small achievement from an earlier chapter of life, fondly remembered).

## Music
I enjoy music and singing, and have learned to play the violin, piano, and saxophone. I also taught myself the Chinese bamboo flute.

## Reading
I enjoy reading, with *The Count of Monte Cristo* and *One Hundred Years of Solitude* among my favorites.

## Video Games
I enjoy competitive video games, particularly MOBA and FPS genres such as League of Legend and Counter-Strike, and appreciate the teamwork and strategy involved.

## Cooking
I enjoy cooking, I am proficient in making many Chinese dishes and like experimenting new cuisines.
